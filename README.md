# 🔐 Password Strength Checker and Crack Time Estimator

A Python script that checks the strength of a password based on several criteria, provides feedback for improvement, and estimates how long it might take for an attacker to crack it.

## 🚀 Features

- Password strength scoring (Very Weak → Very Strong)
- Checks for:
  - Minimum length
  - Numeric characters
  - Uppercase & lowercase letters
  - Special characters
  - Repeating characters
  - Common patterns (e.g., `123456`, `password`)
  - Keyboard patterns (e.g., `qwerty`)
  - Sequential characters (e.g., `abc`, `123`)
- Crack time estimation using brute-force assumptions
- Continuous password input loop (with `exit` to quit)

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or copy the script.
2. Run the script:

```bash
```
python password_checker.py
```
